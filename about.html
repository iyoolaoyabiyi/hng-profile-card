      <h3 id="about-bio-heading">Bio</h3>
      <p>I'm Iyola Oyabiyi: a web developer and performance engineer who thrives at the intersection of precision and creativity. My focus is on building fast, accessible, and resilient interfaces that don't just look good but work right under real-world constraints. I'm drawn to systems thinking (from design tokens and build pipelines to Core Web Vitals and runtime profiling) because the craft isn't complete until the experience is both elegant and efficient.</p>

      <h3 id="about-goals-heading">Goals for This Program</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharpen my collaborative engineering habits — writing cleaner commits, clearer documentation, and more predictable build processes.</li>
        <li>Ship measurable improvements in accessibility and performance, not just functional features.</li>
        <li>Learn from other developers' workflows to refine how I structure projects, manage state, and scale frontends for maintainability.</li>
        <li>Strengthen my leadership voice — giving and receiving technical feedback with clarity and empathy.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="about-page__section" data-testid="test-about-confidence" aria-labelledby="about-confidence-heading">
      <h3 id="about-confidence-heading">Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
      <p>I sometimes over-invest in planning and fine-tuning before shipping. While that attention to detail helps in performance work, it can slow momentum early in projects. I'm learning to balance deep optimization with iteration: to ship, observe, and refine. I'm also building more confidence in backend integrations and deployment automation, ensuring I can take ownership of the full development cycle when needed.</p>

      <h3 id="about-future-heading">Note to Future Me</h3>
      <p>Keep your standards high, but don't let perfection stall progress. The real wins are in consistency: the small improvements that compound over time. Stay curious about how systems interact, from the browser to the server, and don't lose your fascination with why things work the way they do. Keep mentoring others, not because you have all the answers, but because teaching sharpens your perspective and builds the kind of community you once needed.</p>

    <section class="about-page__section" data-testid="test-about-extra" aria-labelledby="about-extra-heading">
      <h3 id="about-extra-heading">Extra Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Technology evolves fast, but depth never goes out of style. Keep focusing on fundamentals  (performance patterns, accessibility, and maintainable architecture) because that's what endures beyond trends. Remember that good engineering isn't about complexity, it's about clarity. Whether it's a single component or a full system, make it simple enough to trust and solid enough to last.</p>
